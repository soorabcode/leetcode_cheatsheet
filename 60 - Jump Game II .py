# Day 60 
# Jump Game II
# You are given a 0-indexed array of integers nums of length n. You are initially positioned at index 0.
# Each element nums[i] represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index i. In other words, if you are at index i, you can jump to any index (i + j) where:
# 0 <= j <= nums[i] and
# i + j < n
# Return the minimum number of jumps to reach index n - 1. The test cases are generated such that you can reach index n - 1.
class Solution:
    def jump(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0
        l = r = 0

        while r < len(nums) - 1:
            far = 0
            for i in range(l, r + 1):
                far = max(far, i + nums[i])

            l = r + 1
            r = far
            res += 1

        return res
