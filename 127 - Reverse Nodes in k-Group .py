# Day 127 
# Reverse Nodes in k-Group 
# Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list k at a time, and return the modified list.
# k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.
# You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
