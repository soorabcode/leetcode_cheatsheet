# Day 91 
# Sum Root to Leaf Numbers 
# You are given the root of a binary tree containing digits from 0 to 9 only.

# Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.

# For example, the root-to-leaf path 1 -> 2 -> 3 represents the number 123.
# Return the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.

# A leaf node is a node with no children.
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
