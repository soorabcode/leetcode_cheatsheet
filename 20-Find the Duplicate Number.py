# DAY 20
# Find the Duplicate Number
# Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.
# There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.
# You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and using only constant extra space.
