# Day 129
# Fibonacci Number 
# The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.

class Solution:
   def fib(self, n: int) -> int:
       if n == 0 :
           return 0
       if n == 1 :
           return 1

       return self.fib(n-2) + self.fib(n-1)
      
# We Can Use Recursion To Solve Fibonacci Sequence
# T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-2)
